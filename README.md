# Email System
The objective of this project is to create a program that controls an email system (much like a simplified version of Outlook), with the obvious exception that emails cannot be sent or received. However, this application will include all of the typical email functions, including the ability to add and remove emails as well as delete, create, and move emails to other folders.
